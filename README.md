# MathCalculator
## by Nick Bartlett

### Project Description

MathCalculator is a calculator web app, with 2 modes - normal and math mode. Normal mode has the basic functions of a calculator, like add, subtract, clear, equals, etc. Math mode is a little more advanced, with trigonmetry functions, natural log, and exponentiation. In the future, integration, math constants, degree/radians mode and more are expected to be added.

### Project Details

MathCalculator is made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I chose to "render" the elements of the calculator to avoid too much HTML and CSS, and also made the JS code more modular with the goal of being easier to understand (i.e. avoid a long script.js file).

### Why I Built MathCalculator

I built MathCalculator as a project to improve my front-end development skills. It likely doesn't have a lot of practical use at the moment as there are many more useful places on the Web that encapsulate what it can do. That being said, I would like to make it a lot slicker and eventually be able to embedded into a webpage, as a widget essentially. But that may or may not ever happen :)
